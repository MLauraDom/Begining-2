           <h4>What is the div tag and why is it important? What is the difference between div and span elements?</h4>
           <p>The div tag represents a container unit that can encapsulate other HTML elements and divide the document into sections or divisions. </br>
            This element is very important and is primarily used to group other HTML elements.</br>
            The div - element is an example of a block-level element and it starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.</br>
            Span is an inline element, it doesn’t start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</br></p>
            <h4>What is the purpose of semantic elements in HTML5?</h4>
            <p>Semantic element are HTML elements for text formatting with or without special meaning. They make the text Bold, Italic, subscript, superscript, strikethrough, etc.</p>
            <h4>Please tell to your partner the name of an HTML5 Semantic element and he/she needs to describe it, then switch the roles.</h4>

            <h4>Why are Meta Tags important and what can you do with Meta Tags?</h4>
            <p> Metadata is sometimes called ‘data about data’. The meta tag can also be used to imitate an HTTP response header (like redirection to a different page) and it can have important attributes like http-equiv and charset. Meta tags are the functionality that is hidden in your code.  </p>
            <h4>Is it possible to have a functional Web page without links?</h4>
            <p>Yes, it`s Possible.If a file is in the same Folder, we can use only the name of the file as a source.</p>
            <h4>Why is the alt tag important for the use of images?</h4>
            <p> If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the text from the alt attribute. Also, the text from the alt is somethimes shown below the Picture, so it`s also usefull for the credits of the Image.</p>
            <h4>How many list types do we have in HTML? Describe them.</h4>
            <p>In HTML we can distinguish three different list types:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Ordered lists (numbered and represented with ol)</li>
                <li>Unordered lists (not numbered and presented with bullets for each list item by default and unordered lists are represented with ul )</li>
                <li>Definition lists (these lists are used when list items need a description and are represented with dl)</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Could we make an entire page layout using tables? How?</h4>
            <p> Yes, it´s possible. As we know, tables are used to arrange data into rows, columns and cells. Tables were used to layout entire pages. Nowadays, that role has been taken over by CSS.</p>
            <h4>What is the purpose of forms in HTML?</h4>
            <p>The HTML form element defines a form that is used to collect user input. To accept input from a user, we must wrap all of your input fields inside a form tag. The form tag indicates where and how the user’s input should be sent.</p>
            <h4>What can you achieve using an iframe element?</h4>
            <p> An iframe enables us to embed a web page within another web page in the same way we add an image to the web page.</p>
            <h4>Why are comments important in well-written code?</h4>
            <p>As developers, we place comments into HTML pages to describe the page code, give information to our fellow developers or to our future selves. This part of code is ignored by the web browsers. Using HTML comments is excellent practice, especially in documents with a lot of code, because we can insert a description about the code, so our Partners can understand what we wanted to do, and also we can remember easily later what we wanted to do with this code.</p>
            <h4>How could you play audio and video in HTML file?</h4>
            <p>To play an audio file in HTML, use the audio element in HTML5.</p>
            <p>To play a video file in HTML, use the video element.</p>
